By day 26, a ganglion cyst appeared on my left hand.

This is not the result I expected. But I am still continuing 100 push up a day.

How? In this post, I will share everything I learned.

 — — — — — — — — — 

I started doing 100 Push up every day on Oct 18 2022. 

Today is the 36th day of my experiment.

**Where is the proof?**

How can you trust me when I say I did 100 push-ups every day for 36 days? 

By day 26, a ganglion cyst appeared on my left hand.

This is not the result I expected. But I am still continuing 100 push up a day.

**Because before and after transformation videos of 100 push-ups a day are mostly fake.**

In the thumbnail of such videos, you can see crazy transformations. Those are fake. You are not going to get ripped just after 30 days.

So what is a normal achievable result? 

I will share my result here.

And, I have proof. I recorded every push-up I did as a part of this challenge. Here you can see the playlist. 

I also took a photo every day after a workout.

### My journey & things I learned.

#### **Day 1 to 10.**

It was a struggle.

The biggest mistake I made was doing all 100 push-ups within 1 hour.

The maximum number of push-ups I could do was 17 or 20.

During this time, I was doing **mostly 10 sets of 10.** 

#### **Day 10 to 20.**

Good results.

The most significant improvement happened during this time. 

I was still doing all push-ups within 1 hour, but did stretching whenever possible and drank a lot of water.

I was able to crank 4 sets of **15 push-ups and then 4 sets of 10 push-ups.**

#### **Day 20 to 30.**

Over training!

The number of continuous push-ups I can do during this time reduced to 10.

Sometime I would do **3 sets of 15 push-ups and then 5 sets of 10/12.**

By the end of this period is when the **ganglion cyst appeared** on my wrist.

#### **Day 30-36**

During this time, pain in the left hand made it impossible to do push-ups. I missed 100 push-ups in a few days. 

Because of the pain, I bought a push-up bar.

And by day 34, decided to do push-ups not within 1 hour, but in separate sections, throughout the day.

Now I am back on track doing 100 push-ups every day.

### Reasons to not do 100 push-ups a day.

**No time for other workouts**

I usually work out for around 1 hour. And the whole time is taken by push up. I do have not time to do other workouts.

**Injury**

By day 26, a ganglion cyst appeared on my left hand. It was there in my hand for 3,4 years but was not painful.

**Over training & plateauing.**

I could feel the effects of over training and could see the number of push-ups I could do going down after a few weeks.

### **Reasons to do 100 push-ups a day.**

**The simplicity of workout and challenge.**

Something about the simplicity of the challenge that will make you keep going.

**Taking to the next level — pushing limits, intensity.**

I always wondered whether i am working out is intence enough. Doing this challenge will test you limits and push you. You can also increase your mental strength.

**Muscle growth**.

Small but visible increase in muscle mass of forearm, chest and biceps, and upper back.

#### My plan for the future — 100 push-ups a day continue or not.

I am still continuing 100 push up a day. But with some changes.

**Changes I made.**

Instead of doing all the push-ups within 1 hour, I split it between all day. Doing 10 or 15 push-ups every few hours.

Started using a push-up bar.

Added a few other workouts on top of push-ups.

Final thoughts: i am going to continue this challenge. But would i recommend this to everyone?I will suggest an alternative option. That is doing 3 times the maximum number of push ups you can do every day.

Ie. if you can do 15 continues push-ups, your goal should be 3*15, 45 push ups every day. And increase the total push-ups as you improve continues push-ups.
