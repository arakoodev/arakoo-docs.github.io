Due to COVID-19 situation, many people are stuck inside home now. Gyms are starting to open in India now(6/08/2020) but still many of us are limited to do workout inside home.

But that doesn't mean we cannot do a full workout session in home including cardio and stretching.

Following is a full body exercise plan for weight loss & fitness that you can do in the comfort of your home. I decided to make it simple by listing all options you can do. Choose one or two from each category and start today.

Offer links for buying all of these products are included in the list. Choose one of many options from each of cardio, stretching, workout or other sport.

# **Cardio**

For cardio following 2 options are best because of limited space in home compared to a gym. You can include some other full body workouts like sit-ups, lunges, push ups along with one of the following.

## **Skipping rope**

Skipping ropes are used by kids to professional athletes. It is simple but can be used in many ways. Starting with normal jumping and landing to insane workouts.

## **Freestyle football**
